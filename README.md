Frogger-3d
==========

Frogger-3D is a game developed  in C++ using the OpenGL API. 

The objective of the game is to direct a frog across a street with 3 lanes, avoiding collision with the cars which move with different velocities. Once the frog has reached the sidewalk it must cross the river by jumping between the planks which move in alternating directions. When the frog jumps into one of the slots, a statue of the frog appears and the position of the player resets.
